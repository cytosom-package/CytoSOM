CytoSOM: a package for easy use of FlowSOM
==========================================
Introduction
==============
CytoSOM helps to apply [FlowSOM](https://github.com/SofieVG/FlowSOM) to flow cytometry data, and perform statistical analysis. You can use the [userguide](https://github.com/gautierstoll/CytoSOM/blob/master/CytoSOM%20User%20Guide.pdf) or read the "HowTo" below.

## Installation

Some dependent packages may not be available directly. They have to be installed first, within bioconductor: [flowCore](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowCore.html), [CytoML](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CytoML.html), [flowWorkspace](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/flowWorkspace.html), [flowSOM](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FlowSOM.html).

Then, you can install CytoSOM:
```R
devtools::install_github(repo ="gautierstoll/CytoSOM")
```

## HowTo

### Using gated data from FlowJo

`CytoSOM` is applied when data has been gated within FlowJo software. A gating can be constructed manually, see below. The data can also be extracted from previously contructed meta-clusters, see below. 

`CytoSOM` needs to be installed. In a folder (eg `MyData`), put your FlowJo sesssion file (eg `file.wsp`) and a sub-folder (eg `FCSdata`) that contains the `.fcs` files (eg `Tube`...`.fcs`)

1. Launch `RStudio`

2. Set your working directory as the folder where your FlowJo session and your data are stored, using the full folder name:
```R
setwd("full_name_before_myData/MyData")
```
Alternatively, it can be done directly in `RStudio`: Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose directory

3. Create an R object that collects your data (eg `CytoData`), indicating the gate (i.e. cell population) of interest drawn in FlowJo (eg `CD45`):
```R
CytoData <- CytoSOM::DownLoadCytoData(dirFCS="FCSdata","CD45",fcsPattern = "Tube",compensate=FALSE)
```
Note in this case, data have already been compensated during acquisition on the flow cytometer.

4. Build a clustering tree (eg `CytoTree`), indicating the list of makers used for clustering (eg `c("CD3","CD4","CD8","CD11b","FOXP3","CD19")`), the size of the cluster grid (eg `7`), the number of meta-clusters (eg `25`), and the seed of the random generator (eg `0`):
```R
CytoTree <- CytoSOM::buildFSOMTree(CytoData,c("CD3","CD4","CD8","CD11b","FOXP3","CD19"),7,25,0)
```
Note that `buildFSOMTree` need to have the compensated names of the markers, that can be extracted from the object `CytoData` by the commande `as.vector(gsub(" <.*>","",CytoData$fSOMData$prettyColnames))`

5. Plot the tree
```R
CytoSOM::PlotStarsMSTRm(CytoTree$fSOMTree,CytoTree$metaCl,"Title Name",0)
```
If the smallest clusters make the image diffcult to interpret, you can plot the tree by removing the smallest clusters (eg remove the 3 smallest clusters):
```R
CytoSOM::PlotStarsMSTRm(CytoTree$fSOMTree,CytoTree$metaCl,"Title Name",3)
```
If the tree looks satisfactory, you can move on to the next step. Otherwise, try to rebuild the tree with different parameters (ie size of the cluster grid and/or number of meta-clusters)

6. Rename the meta-clusters, switching from a meta-cluster number to an explicit phenotype, by defining the set of markers to consider (eg `c("CD4","CD8","CD11b","FOXP3","CD19")`):
```R
CytoTree <- CytoSOM::TreeMetaRenaming(CytoTree,c("CD4","CD8","CD11b","FOXP3", "CD19"),"shortRobustName")
```

7. Download an annotation table in `.csv` format (eg `AnnotationTable.csv`), that contains a column 'files', a column 'Treatment' and an optional column 'NormalizationFactor', indicating the separator (eg `;`):
```R
tableTreatmentFCS <- read.csv("AnnotationTable.csv",sep=";")
```

8. Plot trees in `.pdf` files, for different population sizes and different markers (eg `c("MHCII","PD1","PDL1","PDL2")`):
```R
CytoSOM::plotTreeSet(CytoTree ,c("MHCII","PD1","PDL1","PDL2"),"TitleTrees",rmClNb=0,tableTreatmentFCS,globalScale=T)
```
This command generates two `.pdf` files for visual comparison of the clusters (i.e. cell subsets) based on their size and on the expression profile of markers to define (eg `c("MHCII","PD1","PDL1","PDL2")`): `TitleTrees_ClusterTree.pdf` and `TitleTrees_MarkerTree.pdf`.

9. Perform statistical analysis of meta-cluster sizes:
```R
StatAnalysisSizes <- CytoSOM::BoxPlotMetaClust(CytoTree,Title="MyTitle",tableTreatmentFCS,ControlTreatmen="PBS",
BottomMargin=3,yLab="CD45",Norm=FALSE,Robust = TRUE,ClustHeat=TRUE)
```
If `Norm` is set to `TRUE`, the column 'NormalizationFactor' of the `.csv` table is used to normalize the meta-cluster sizes. Otherwise, the analysis is perfomed on relative size (percentage). The control treatment is used for statistical annotation of population size heatmap. A file `MyTitle_BoxPlotPercentMetaClust.pdf` is produced. Two files containing p-values are also generated: `MyTitle_LmPvalPercentMetacl.csv` and `MyTitle_PairwisePvalPercentMetacl.csv`

10. Perform statistical analysis of a given marker (eg PD1) MFI, across the different meta-clusters:
```R
StatAnalysisPD1 <- CytoSOM::BoxPlotMarkerMetaClust(CytoTree,Title="MyTitle",tableTreatmentFCS,ControlTreatmen="PBS",
BottomMargin=3,"PD1",Robust = TRUE,ClustHeat=TRUE)
```
A file `MyTitle_BoxPlotPD1MetaClust.pdf` is produced. Two files containing p-values are also generated: `MyTitle_LmPvalPD1Metacl.csv` and `MyTitle_PairwisePvalPD1Metacl.csv`

### Gating without FlowJo

`CytoSOM` needs to be installed. In a folder (eg `MyData`), put a sub-folder (eg `FCSdata`) that contains the `.fcs` files (eg `Tube`...`.fcs`)

1. Launch `RStudio`

2. Set your working directory as the folder where your data are stored, using the full folder name:
```R
setwd("full_name_before_myData/MyData")
```
Alternatively, it can be done directly in `RStudio`: Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose directory

3. Download the data:

```R
RawData <- FlowSOM::ReadInput(input = "FCSdata",pattern = "Tube",compensate = F)
```
Note: in this case, data have already been compensated during acquisition on the flow cytometer.

4. Create two polygon gates, eg the first one within the 2D plot "FSC-A" x "SSC-A" using `.fcs` files 1 and 3, the second one within the 2D plot "FSC-A" x "Livedead" (from 0 to 10000) using `.fcs` files 2 and 4 (order of files are the order that can be seen in `RawData$metaData`):
```R
Poly1 <- CytoSOM::InteractivePolyGate(RawData,marker1 = "FSC-A",marker2 = "SSC-A",fcsFiles = c(1,3))
Poly2 <- CytoSOM::InteractivePolyGate(RawData,marker1 = "FSC-A",marker2 = "Livedead",fcsFiles = c(2,4),ylim=c(0,10000))
```
Any list of files can be used to contruct a polygon gate. The order of files are the order that can be seen in `RawData$metaData`. Instead, file names can be provided.


5. Create an R object (dataset) with the intersection of the two polygon gates above, with a chosen name (eg "myGate"):
```R
CytoData <- CytoSOM::PolygonGatingRawData(RawData,Polygons = list(Poly1,Poly2),gatingName = "myGate”)
```

6. A new polygon can be applied to this gated dataset:

```R
Poly3 <- CytoSOM::InteractivePolyGate(CytoData$fSOMData,marker1 = "SSC-H",marker2 = "Livedead",fcsFiles = c(8,10))
CytoData <- CytoSOM::PolygonGatingGatedData(CytoData,Polygons = list(Poly3),gatingName = "CD45”)
```

Then the analysis can be continued at point 4 above ("Using gated data from FlowJo").

### Extracting data from meta-clusters

Suppose that data has been downloaded (eg `CytoData`), and a cluster tree has been constructed (eg `CytoTree`). A sub-dataset can be extracted from a list of metaclusters (eg `c(1,3)`):
```R
SubCytoData <- CytoSOM::DataFromMetaClust(CytoData$fSOMData,CytoTree,c(1,3))
```
Then a new tree can be constructed, continuing at point 4 of HowTo above ("Using gated data from FlowJo").

If meta-clusters have been renamed, the list of exact names should be provided. For that, the function `FindMetaClustNames` can be useful. For instance, 
```R
clusterNames <- FindMetaClustNames(subNames = c("CD4+","FOXP3-"),TreeMetaClust = CytoTree)
``` 
finds all meta-clusters having "CD4+" and "FOXP3-" in their name. In a similar way, if meta-clusters have been renamed by `TreeMetaRenaming`, 
```R
clusterNames <- FindMetaClustNames(subNames = "^4_",TreeMetaClust = CytoTree)
```
finds the name of the meta-cluster number 4.
